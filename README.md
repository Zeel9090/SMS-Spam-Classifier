# SMS Spam Detection

Designing a machine-learning model to identify spam messages in SMS text data is the purpose of this research. To categorize SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham), it makes use of supervised learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "SMS Spam Collection" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a collection of 5,574 SMS messages, labeled as spam or ham. The dataset can be downloaded from [link to dataset] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).

The dataset file (sms_spam_dataset.csv) contains two columns:
 * label: Indicates whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).
 * text: The actual text content of the SMS message
